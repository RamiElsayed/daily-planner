# daily-planner
This homework i relied on my recently developed web development skills to build the page
I stuck to the easiest most effective solutions for every problem
Organised my classes (functions) in a sequential matter 
I made sure classes names made sense and could be read in plane English
used colors library to distinguish which colors i used where
Added media query for small screens less than 600 px
I was going to add a function that disable input in the past but though it's not sufficient as in real life u should be allowed to modify past planners with notes
I added a button later as I designed it to save automatically initially but modified to requirements
